# Python-Project-Bank

In this project, we will make an simple banking program. With the help of this program, users can open a new account and delete their account. With their user ID and password , users can login the program. After that, there will be 3 option, insert money, withdraw money and transfer money. In the end, users logout from the program. We will use Tkinter as GUI and save the users information in "txt" files.

# Python-Project-Bank

In this project, we will make an simple banking program. With the help of this program, users can open a new account and delete their account. With their user ID and password , users can login the program. After that, there will be 3 option, insert money, withdraw money and transfer money. In the end, users logout from the program. We will use Tkinter as GUI and save the users information in "txt" files.

Also the program keeps all the records which was done by user. The records include insert money, withdraw money, open account, delete account and transfer money. All these records save in txt file, with the user account number by addind the current time.
